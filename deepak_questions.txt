Does K-NN require labels in the training data?

Is K-NN a good method to use when we have a large number of features?

Consider the following methods to set K to its optimal value, (A) Run K-NN several times with different values of K and choose the one with best performance on the training dataset, (B) Run K-NN several times with different values of K and choose the one with best cross-validation performance. Which of the following is correct:
(i) Only (A)
(ii) Only (B)
(iii) Both (A) and (B)

How can we change the value of K while running K-NN in R?

What method can I use in R to perform 3 fold cross-validation using K-NN?

How many parameters should we learn for a logistic regression classifier when we have d features in the data?

Does the logistic regression classifier in R output
(a) A class vlaue for each instance
(b) A probability value for each instance

When does logistic regression work well?

Write a small R script that performs Logistic Regression with a threshold equal to 0.75

In K-Means algorithm, what is K?

In R, how can I change the value of K when calling K-Means?
